If you don't have Debug installed, try opening MSDOS and type:
color 57

The first number is the backgorund color and the second the text
0 = Black	8 = Gray
1 = Blue	9 = Light Blue
2 = Green	A = Light Green
3 = Aqua	B = Light Aqua
4 = Red	C = Light Red
5 = Purple	D = Light Purple

If you want to make it permanent, open the properties dialog and change it there.
If you change colors this way, you will loose bold style.
